This version of WOD is as of 9/15/1998. Grenades have been balanced,
some Id DM bugs have been fixed, and the newest VWep has been integrated
in. I'm still getting some "no such oldframe" message cascades, though.

Next I plan to cut out the monster code, and to rework FindItem().
I also have some specific DM-related things to modify.
