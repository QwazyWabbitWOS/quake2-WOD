6.02 changes
------------
(DONE) Grenades, grenade launcher, bazooka, and laser tripwires:
	Change grenade selection interface so that, once they select a grenade type,
	they stick with it until they select another type.  Then have the grenade
	launcher launch whatever type of grenade they selected last.  Then add a
	new weapon, the new alternate grenade launcher, the bazooka.  It fires
	whatever type of grenade they selected last, but instead of lobbing a
	bouncing grenade, it shoots it in a straight line and the grenade explodes
	as soon as it touches something.  Then change laser tripwires so that
	they act more like the Duke Nukem 3D variety, but fire all the different
	types of grenades.  Allow the wall-mounted grenade to be shot, and react to
	radius damage.
(DONE) Change the plasma rifle into the bolt thrower.  Make it use the
	hyperblaster model.
(DONE) Make the homing rocket launcher take 1 rocket per shot, but the missiles are
	shootable & do only as much damage as they have health.
BUG: homing rockets can't be hit with gi.trace()-based weapons, but entity-based
	weapons hit it just fine.  WTF?

Weapon/feature banning
Totally verify all precaching info with what's actually being used.
New grenade type: pineapple grenade.  Explodes like a multi-directional shotgun
	blast.

To do
-----
If someone can gib a person who's still alive, make them have blood trails
	and identifiable body parts.  Have them bounce and even ricochet.  Have
	them blow apart in a direction that makes sense given the impact on the
	body.  So rocket and grenade hits would cause blood and gibs to sort of
	radiate backward from that point, super shotgun blasts would cut people in
	half, and so on.
A "say_to" command that allows people to send private messages to each other.
	Any way to make a messagemode for it?
Fix grappling hook so it doesn't need aliases.
Make the HUD look more like Lithium's.
Make jetpack dropable.
Drop jetpack when the player using it is fragged.  That would add lots more
	jetpacks to the game, altering the dynamic.
Redo "frozen" effect to be more intuitive for the frozen person.  At a minimum,
	don't allow them to pivot or fire.
The freeze code looks totally broken.  WTF is up with it?
Rearrange the files in pak1.pak so they're in their "standard" location.  (The
	main offender here is the fire model/skin.)  Then I will be able to precache
	them, and make them available for download.
maplist should control not just the map, but the # of players that need to be
	present for the map to be run (so big maps can be run), and maybe even set
	coop, ctf, and other flags.  Then a single server could alternate between
	coop, deathmatch, and CTF!  Pretty wild.
blackbox.efs.org suggestions: flood protection, chat overflow protection,
	IP banning, frag logging.
JustShootMe suggestions: more types of grappling hooks, less-busy cataclysm
	device explosion.
Integrate in GibStats?  http://www.planetquake.com/gibstats/
Integrate in Eraser bot.  http://impact.frag.com/
The ChaseCam needs to be reconciled with VWep, and should allow a spectator
	mode.
"Com_sprintf: overflow of 67 in 64".  Eh?
Push/pull needs to make the user more detectable and vulnerable.  A beam of
	light connecting the players?  The quad sound when push/pull is used?  The
	pushed/pulled person has their view turned to look at the attacker?
Be able to push/pull dropped player items.  Now it's really a Jedi thing!  But
	would this require an engine change?
Scoreboard times should be in minutes and seconds.
Allow railgun to shoot through walls?!  That'd be pretty wild.

To do, lower priority
---------------------
Better monster AI.  They need to understand the notion of cover, at a minimum.
Have insane turn into an anti-monster "bot" once you touch them, or do something
	else to "save" them.
Reduce weapons strength for SP game.
Scanner should detect monsters during single-player game.

New weapon ideas
----------------
Gas grenades!  How to draw gas?
Freeze grenades!
Light saber as the new alternate blaster.  Even more Jedi stuff!
