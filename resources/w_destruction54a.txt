Description of Weapons of Destruction 5.4 Weapons
======================================================

This is a combo mod and changes most of the weapons and adds some new features.
The new weapons and features:

---------
Weapons
---------

Freeze Gun: This gun does exactly what it says. The enemy freezes.
Shoot them once and they freeze, if you shoot them again they will go into
a deep freeze and stay frozen longer. Uses 10 cells per fire.

Sniper Gun: Very powerful, but has a slow reload time.

Homing Rocket Launcher: Shoot it. Watch it chase them down. Select by
pressing 7 twice.

Swinging Grappling hook: Press G to fire it, use R to go up, and F to go
down.

darKMajick grenades: What these are:

-Cluster grenade - needs no explanation.
-Railbomb - when exploded, shoots railgun shots in 5 directions.
-Shrapnel Grenade - when it explodes, it throws flaming debris everywhere,
shredding all it touches.
-Napalm Grenade - If you ever played Teamfortress as the Pyro, you 
should know what this is. It explodes into a few other grenades,
firing up the surrounded area. Very cool effects in GL mode.
-Plasma Grenade - sure to eliminate your enemy. It's like a BFG shot
in a nice little compact grenade.
-Cataclysm - This has to be seen to be believed. It explodes, causes
the area to rumble, sending out a big circle of fire and a HUGE 
explosion. Use with caution.

Super Blaster- Press 1 again with the blaster, and you'll get the super
blaster. It shoots powerful laser bolts (with a red color shell)
and does alot of damage.

Fire Rocket Launcher- This awesome weapon fires
a rocket, when it hits a target or wall, a cluster of fire rains down.
Very cool.

Standard Machinegun- Has two firemodes, automatic and busrt fire.
Use "cmd firemode" to toggle

Fire Grenade Launcher- It's like the fire rocket in a nice little
grenade.

Machine Gun Rockets- The machine gun now fires weakened rockets, and
eats up ammo very fast.

Triple Hyperblaster- this one is really powerful and eats up ammo very fast.
It shoots 3 lasers at once instead of 1.

Flame Thrower- This replaces the railgun. Here's the specifics (partly
from the Napalm mod text file by Patrick Martin):

     If your player catches on fire, he will burn for at
least 5 seconds.  The following will extinguish the fire:
  * The player immerses in liquid at waist deep.
    Crouching can help if the liquid is too shallow.
  * The player picks up adrenaline or megahealth.
  * The player activates a pentagram of protection.
  * Health box has a percent chance equal to its power of
    extinguishing the fire.  If the fire is not extinguished,
    then it will speed up the time when the fire burns out.
  * A bio-suit greatly reduces the chances of catching on fire
    and offers partial immunity to indirect fire damage.
  * Active power armor reduces the chance of igniting.
  * If a fire "ignites" a target already on fire, then the
    time before the fire burns out is reset.
  * All frags (and anger) go to the entity who ignited the
    target most recently.
  * Some monsters, such as tanks or bosses (except the makron), cannot burn.
The flame thrower uses 1 slug per fire and fires quite rapidly.
Slugs come in pakc sof 50 now and the maximum capacity is 200

*Standard railgun now takes 4 slugs per fire due to the capacity of
200*

Laser Tripwires- Go up to a wall and set one, when a monster or a player
walks through, -riiiiiiip!-

Tractor Beam- Pull player or monster toward you or push them away.

Kamikaze- This isn't entirely a weapon, since it kills you, so it is
intended for deathmatch only. It sends a big explosion from where you die-
kinda like strapping a huge timebomb on your chest and setting it off.

----------
Features
----------

ChaseCam- Activate this and you have a behind the player view, kind
of like Tomb Raider or Fade to Black (if any of you played that
one).

Decoy- Sort of like the Hologram in Duke3D, except it shoots at
players.

Visible Weapons- You can see what weapon your opponent is holding in DM or
using the Chasecam.

Scanner- Track those players down in DM.

You can push or pull enemies / players [see commands section]

The blaster- now shoots much faster, and the lasers look more realistic 
(transparent red or blue).

Jetpack- This one is awesome. You must have picked up the quad to use
it. When you use it, you move as if you're in water, but you sway and stuff
when flying, it's so realistic you have to use it.

Lasersight- press the "S" key to activate the laser sight.

Sniper Zooming- Press F11 to cycle through views and f10 to switch back
to your normal view as a sort of a "panic button".

Night Vision- this only works right in GL (3dfx) mode.

The super shotgun now has a big kickback. Try going up to a monster
or player, crouching, and aiming up and shoot 'em. They go flying.

========================
Installation - Important
========================

Make a directory in your Quake2 Directory, 

Say c:\quake2\weapons

Unzip my mod using winzip -or- pkunzip -d w_destruction54.zip
Put all unzipped files into c:\quake2\weapons

Now, just go to the start menu, then go to run, and
type: c:\quake2\quake2 +set game weapons

or if that doesn't work,
type: c:\quake2\quake2 +set game weapons

If it still doesnt work, reinstall Quake2 and install the 3.14 patch.
Else, you're on your own.

Fire up single player\deathmatch\coop, and go at it.
There, that wasn't hard, was it?

You must have Quake2 version 3.14 to run this patch.
